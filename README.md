# TerminationShock
TerminationShock is a multiplayer game made for Spielmarmelade 2015 (https://www.fsmpi.rwth-aachen.de/gamejam/). The theme was "Fallen" (mind the german translations - "traps" or "to fall")

Heavily inspired by Event Horizon (as is the name) one player plays the AI of an abandoned spaceship floating in space, that went rogue and killed it's crew.
The other player plays an astronaut that was sent on a rescue mission, trying to find his way through the abandoned ship. The AI though tries to foil his plans and impede his advancements by constructing elaborate networks of sensors and traps.

Also the game was a very ambitious project, so the jam version is *very* incomplete. We will probably continue working on it for a while, but the jam version is available here:

## Important Notes
Please note that the map generator may generate levels which are very difficult (bordering impossible) to beat playing the astronaut. For now the workaround is for the spaceship player to have a quick glance and see if the levels might require jumps that are too hard to make.
